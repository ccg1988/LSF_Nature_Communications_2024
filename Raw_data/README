Raw extracellular spiking data for reproducing Figure 1-5

Due to the 25 MB limit of a single file, we cut the spiking data of M43S into two folders

We did not upload the raw waveform of action potential (unrelated to this study) and membrane potential (Figure 6) due to the file size limit

Figure 7 does not need experimental data and the codes are contained in three folders: Ex_In_Syn_Amplitude
